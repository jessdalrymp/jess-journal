Using the user's previous chat history, identify a specific emotional, psychological, or cognitive challenge they've been working through. Generate a unique, LGAT-style (large group awareness training) real-world action that directly engages them in an experiential, embodied learning process.

This process should:
- Bypass intellectual defenses
- Create emotional shifts
- Offer a visceral 'aha' moment
- Be immersive, slightly uncomfortable but safe
- Push the user beyond their normal thought patterns and behavioral loops

Constraints:
- The exercise must be surprising, playful, and counterintuitive (not just a standard CBT worksheet or meditation)
- Use NLP reframing techniques, cognitive dissonance triggers, or physical movement-based processes to create a real, embodied shift
- Include an unexpected social or environmental component that breaks the user's routine and activates new insights
- The user must actively engage in the process (not just reflect or journal) and take real-world action that disrupts their habitual responses
- The exercise should reveal hidden assumptions or unconscious commitments, making them visible through action rather than abstract discussion

Present the challenge in a clear, step-by-step format, explaining both what to do and the psychological purpose behind it. Be supportive but push for real action and commitment.`;
